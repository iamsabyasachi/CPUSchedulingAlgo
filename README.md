Here's a `README.md` file for your CPU Scheduling Simulator project on GitHub:

# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a Java-based GUI application that simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms. The simulator supports the following scheduling algorithms:

- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Non-Preemptive
- Shortest Time First (STF)

## Features

- **Add Processes:** You can add processes with specified arrival time, burst time, and priority.
- **Select Scheduling Algorithm:** Choose between Round Robin, Priority Non-Preemptive, and Shortest Time First algorithms.
- **Simulate Scheduling:** The simulator will execute the chosen scheduling algorithm and display the process execution timeline.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor (e.g., VS Code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scheduling-simulator.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Run the `SchedulingSimulator` class.

### Usage

1. Enter the number of processes in the "Number of Processes" field.
2. (Optional) For Round Robin scheduling, enter the time quantum in the "Time Quantum" field.
3. Add processes by entering their arrival time, burst time, and priority (for Priority Non-Preemptive scheduling).
4. Click "Add Process" to add the process to the list.
5. Select the desired scheduling algorithm from the dropdown.
6. Click "Start Scheduling" to begin the simulation. The execution timeline will be displayed in the output area.

### Example

1. Add Process 1: Arrival Time = 0, Burst Time = 5, Priority = 2
2. Add Process 2: Arrival Time = 2, Burst Time = 3, Priority = 1
3. Select "Round Robin" with a time quantum of 2.
4. Click "Start Scheduling" to see the process execution timeline.
